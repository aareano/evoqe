This is the Android application project code for the app 'evoqe'.

Description:
The app provides the service of consolidating information about current events on campus as well as providing clean and consise information about (advertising) local businesses.
The data comes from clubs/teams/etc. when they upload their events via the web app http://evoqeapp.com/ . There is already an iOS app releaed (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evoqe-previously-weparty/id793107305?mt=8), so this app is building the user base of an already existing product.

This app is not yet released. While it is largely functional, there is some polishing to do with transitions and keeping it from  crashing and things. When it is released, a link to it will be placed here.

Note: There are a few files missing from this project as they contain sensitive data, however, if you want an .apk file, let me knwo and we'll see what we can do.
